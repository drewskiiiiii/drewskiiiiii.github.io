        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, I am from Riverside, CA and I am currently 19 years old. Growing up as an only child made me become independent at a fast rate. I have played a variety of sports and been invloved in multiple clubs/organizations. I am currently enrolled as a second year student at the University of California, Riverside. I am pursuing to take on a degree in business administration.  <br><br>

        Math has always been my strong suit. This allowed me to realize I wanted to work in the business field. I have a very passionate drive towards working hard in everything I do. My upbringing allowed for me to have a strong mindset in life even when it gets hard. I am always ready to embrace a new challenge. Along with that, I would consider myself a very social person. This lead to me joining the Kappa Sigma Fraternity at my school. Through this, I have learned and gained more opportunities than I ever would if I did not take that step. I have taken on many leadership postions throughout my life as well. This ranges from being a sports captain, president of clubs, and having a chair position in my fraternity.<br><br>

        Currently pursuing a degree in business administration, I have aspirations to make a mark in the real estate industry. Combining a love for entrepreneurship with a commitment to building strong relationships, I aim to create opportunities that benefit communities and clients alike. Some of my hobbies include making music/djing, going to the gym, cooking, reading, or spending time with friends and family. My goals are to be a successful business owner and use that to develop sales in real estate. I am excited to continue this path in my life. I would love to travel the world and be able to work from home if that opportunity came.Even though I am 19 years old, I have helped make sales for real estate agents. Ive also produced more than $18k in sales of home renovations. I really enjoy having that salesman personality ability. It gives me an advantage for my future when that skill will be needed. Working under a sport's company financials would be one of my dream jobs. I am still deciding what field of business administration I want to pursue. It is between accounting and finance, but I am open minded towards these topics.
